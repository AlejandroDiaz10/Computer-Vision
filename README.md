# Computer Vision and Digital Image Processing

This repository contains projects developed as part of the course **Computer Vision and Digital Image Processing**, focused on the application of modern computer vision techniques and algorithms for digital image analysis and processing. Each module explores a different aspect of computer vision through hands-on projects and practical implementations.

## Course Modules and Projects

### Module 1: Introduction to Image Processing  
**Topic:** Fundamentals of digital image processing and basic operations  
**Project:** Implementation of basic image processing operations including image loading, display, format conversion, and fundamental pixel-level manipulations.

### Module 2: Image Transformations and Enhancement  
**Topic:** Geometric transformations and image quality improvement techniques  
**Project:** Development of image enhancement algorithms including noise reduction, contrast adjustment, histogram equalization, and geometric transformations such as rotation, scaling, and translation.

### Module 3: Feature Descriptors  
**Topic:** Feature detection and description algorithms  
**Project:** Implementation of feature extraction techniques including edge detection (Canny, Sobel), corner detection (Harris, FAST), and advanced descriptors (SIFT, SURF, ORB) for image analysis and matching.

### Module 4: Color Models  
**Topic:** Color space representations and color-based image processing  
**Project:** Design and implementation of color space conversion algorithms (RGB, HSV, LAB, YUV) and color-based image segmentation and analysis techniques.

### Module 5: Image Segmentation  
**Topic:** Region-based and boundary-based segmentation methods  
**Project:** Development of image segmentation algorithms including thresholding techniques, region growing, watershed segmentation, and clustering-based approaches for object identification and boundary detection.

### Module 6: Optical Flow in Video  
**Topic:** Motion estimation and tracking in video sequences  
**Project:** Implementation of optical flow algorithms including Lucas-Kanade and Horn-Schunck methods for motion detection, object tracking, and video analysis applications.
